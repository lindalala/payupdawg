payupdawg
=========

This web app keeps track of shared expenses between groups of people, like roommates who regularly split grocery bills for example. It is written in Python/Django with SQLite as its database.

Random Notes: 

After forking and cloning, remember to change some of the directory paths in settings.py to point to the correct places before runnning the django server.

createdb.py populates the database with dummy data for testing purposes.

To-do list:

- Push notifications for grocery shopping
- Keep track of payments that have been made
- Upload pictures of receipts for record-keeping purposes
- Choose to pay a larger share on certain bills
- Delete receipts
- Improve form validation
